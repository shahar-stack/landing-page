This is my second project's README file.
This project will have me building a landing page from scratch. That includes an index html file as well as a styles css file for visual customization.
Once finished, the landing page will include a header as well as a hero text and image at its top. Below there will be some more information, a quote section, a Sign up section, and finally a footer.
This will mainly test my newly learned Flexbox skills to align and place everything on the page where I want it to be.
